    <h1>Trip to Nigeria</h1>
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>I decided to travel to nigeria to get a better view of how a post-colonial country is doing.</p>
    <p>I took a plane from Gardemoen and landed in the capital Abuja the trip itself cost 8241 kr and it took a little over 10 hours.</p>
    <p>When I arrived in Abuja is quite late so I decided to take a taxi to the hotel I was staying at Angel Park place Hotel it cost 458 kr per night and had a nice cozy room.</p>
    <h2>Museum Trip</h2>
    <p>The next day I decided to visit the national museum to get a better view of the history of Nigeria pre-colonialism, but it was in Lagos so it took a while to travel there.</p>
    <p>I found out that Nigeria was mostly a hunter gatherer community with many kingdoms and many languages.</p>
    <p>I decided to ask one of the workers why Britain was interested in Nigeria in the first place and they said that Britain was mostly interested for the resources.</p>
    <p>After the trip to the museum I deccided to get some food at a local restaurant where i ordered some Jollof which is the national dish in Nigeria it consists mostly of rice and spices.</p>
    <h2>Traveling Around</h2>
    <p>The next few days I decided to just travel around the city and just looking around and taking in the country.</p>
    <p>I went around some official builidngs and was surprised to see that most of the signs was in english so I asked a bit around and found out that english was the national language in Nigeria.</p>
    <p>I also found out through the many times I had talked to Nigerians that they have their own dialect of English where they use some different words and fraces.</p>
    <p>this caught me offguard many times due to my unfamiliarity with it.</p>
    <p>I even visited a football stadium though there were no games at the moment. during my trip to the stadium I also learned that football is very popular.</p>
    <p>I checked out the national assembly building where they handle political matters</p> <p>I also found out they still have English law.</p>
    <P>From what i could tell Nigeria still has good relations with Britain and the closest controversy/problem would be the biafra rebellion</P>
